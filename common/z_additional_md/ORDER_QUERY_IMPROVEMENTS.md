# Order Query Improvements - Smart Session-Based Search

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Purpose:** Improved order query handling with automatic session email fallback

---

## Problem Statement

### Original Issues:

1. **"I placed an order earlier"** → ❌ Extracted "earlier" as cart_id → Failed
2. **"Do I have an order with total 330?"** → ❌ No parameters extracted → Failed
3. **Error messages not helpful** → Just said "Cart not found"

### User Experience Impact:
- Users couldn't use natural language for order queries
- Had to know specific cart IDs
- Vague queries failed completely

---

## Solution Overview

### ✅ **Smart Parameter Extraction**

The system now intelligently determines search parameters:

1. **Specific cart ID** → Use cart_id (highest priority)
2. **Email in query** → Use customer_email
3. **Order-related keywords** → Use session email (fallback)
4. **No session** → Graceful error message

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Improved Cart ID Validation**

**Old pattern (too loose):**
```python
r'\b(?:cart|Cart|CART)[\s#:]*([A-Za-z0-9]{1,15})\b'  # Matched "cart earlier" ❌
```

**New pattern (strict):**
```python
r'\bcart\s*(\d+)\b'      # Only "cart 454" ✅
r'\border\s*(\d+)\b'     # Only "order 123" ✅
r'\b(cart\w{3,})\b'      # Only "cart454" or longer ✅
```

**Validation added:**
```python
if cart_id.isdigit() or (cart_id.lower().startswith('cart') and len(cart_id) > 4):
    # Valid cart ID
else:
    # Skip this match (e.g., "earlier", "yesterday")
```

---

### 2. **Order Keyword Detection**

**New logic:** Detect if query is about orders even without cart ID

**Keywords that trigger order search:**
```python
order_keywords = [
    'order', 'cart', 'purchase', 'bought', 'placed',
    'total', 'amount', 'price', 'shipment', 'delivery',
    'tracking', 'status', 'invoice', 'receipt'
]
```

**Examples:**
- "Do I have an order with total 330?" → Contains "order" and "total" ✅
- "my purchase earlier" → Contains "purchase" ✅
- "shipment status" → Contains "shipment" ✅

---

### 3. **Session Email Fallback**

When order query detected but no specific cart_id:

```python
if is_order_query and not cart_id_found and self.user_session:
    if email := self.user_session.get('email'):
        logger.info(f"Order query detected, using session email: {email}")
        return {"customer_email": email}
```

**User session contains:**
- user_id
- name
- email ← Used for order search
- mobile
- registered_at

---

### 4. **Enhanced Response Messages**

**When cart not found:**
```python
# Old (not helpful):
"Cart not found for: cart_id=earlier"

# New (helpful):
"No active cart found for your email (harish.achappa@gmail.com). 
You may not have any pending orders."
```

**When cart found:**
```python
# Old:
Cart details for Harish Achappa
Cart ID 454, Active Cart
Total: ₹199.97
Email: harish.achappa@gmail.com

# New (with context):
Cart details for Harish Achappa
(Searched by your email: harish.achappa@gmail.com)
Cart ID 454, Active Cart
Total: ₹199.97
Email: harish.achappa@gmail.com
```

---

## Query Examples - Before & After

### Example 1: Vague Time Reference

**Query:** "I placed an order earlier"

**Before:**
```
❌ Extracted: cart_id="earlier"
❌ Error: Cart not found for: cart_id=earlier
```

**After:**
```
✅ Detected order keywords: "order", "placed"
✅ Using session email: harish.achappa@gmail.com
✅ Response: Cart details for Harish Achappa
            (Searched by your email: harish.achappa@gmail.com)
            Cart ID 454, Active Cart
            Total: ₹199.97
```

---

### Example 2: Order Property Query

**Query:** "Do I have an order with total 330?"

**Before:**
```
❌ No parameters extracted
❌ Error: At least one of cart_id, customer_email, or customer_full_name must be provided
```

**After:**
```
✅ Detected order keywords: "order", "total"
✅ Using session email: harish.achappa@gmail.com
✅ Response: Cart details for Harish Achappa

            Total: ₹199.97
            
Note: User asked about total 330, actual total is 199.97
```

---

### Example 3: No Cart Found

**Query:** "my order status"

**Before:**
```
❌ Error: At least one of cart_id, customer_email, or customer_full_name must be provided
```

**After (with cart):**
```
✅ Using session email: user@example.com
✅ Response: Cart details...
```

**After (no cart):**
```
✅ Using session email: user@example.com

INFO - Order query detected, using session email: harish.achappa@gmail.com
INFO - GetOrderTool: Searching by email: harish.achappa@gmail.com
INFO - GetOrderTool: Query returned 1 rows
```

### **Cart ID Extraction:**

## Future Enhancements

### Planned for Phase 2:

1. **Amount/Total Filtering:**
   ```python
   # Extract amount from query
   "order with total 330" → Extract 330
   # Filter results by total amount
   if extracted_amount and abs(cart_total - extracted_amount) > 10:
       response += f"\n\nNote: You asked about ₹{extracted_amount}, but your cart total is ₹{cart_total}"
   ```

2. **Multiple Orders Support:**
   - Currently returns first active cart
   - Could return all user's carts
   - Let user select which one

3. **Order History:**
   - Support completed orders (not just active carts)
   - Date range filtering
   - Status filtering

---

Check for email in query text
    ├─ "user@example.com" found? → Use email ✅
    └─ Not found → Continue ↓
    
Check for order-related keywords
    ├─ "order", "total" found? → YES ✅
    └─ Is order query? → YES ↓
    
Check user session
    ├─ Session email exists? → YES ✅
    │   └─ Use session email
    │
    ├─ Session name exists? → Use name
    │
    └─ No session → Return empty (error)
