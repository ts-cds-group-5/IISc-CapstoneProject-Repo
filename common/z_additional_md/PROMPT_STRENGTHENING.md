# Prompt Strengthening - Enhanced Few-Shot Examples

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Purpose:** Improve Llama 3.2 tool detection accuracy with comprehensive few-shot examples

---

## 🎯 **Problem: Llama 3.2 Confusion**

### **Before Strengthening:**

| User Query | Llama Chose | Should Be | Result |
|------------|-------------|-----------|--------|
| "show me Books" | searchproducts ❌ | getcatalog ✅ | No products found |
| "do you have Books?" | searchproducts ❌ | getcatalog ✅ | No products found |
| "do you have Electronics?" | searchproducts ❌ | getcatalog ✅ | No products found |
| "show Electronics" | searchproducts ❌ | getcatalog ✅ | No products found |

**Why?** Llama didn't have enough examples distinguishing **collection names** vs **product searches**

---

## 🔧 **Solution: Comprehensive Few-Shot Examples**

### **Before: 14 Examples**
- Generic coverage
- Not enough edge cases
- Ambiguous distinction between tools

### **After: 28 Examples** ✅
- Organized by category
- Multiple variations per pattern
- Clear collection vs product distinction
- Order query emphasis

---

## 📊 **New Prompt Structure**

### **1. Critical Rules (Lines 56-59)**
```
CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
1. COLLECTIONS (Books, Electronics, Furniture, Clothing) → ALWAYS getcatalog
2. PRODUCT NAMES (Samsung, laptop, chair) → searchproducts
3. ORDER QUERIES ("my order") → ALWAYS getorder, NEVER searchproducts
```

### **2. Collection Catalog Examples (9 examples)**
```python
"Show me Books" → getcatalog(collection_name="Books")
"do you have Books?" → getcatalog(collection_name="Books")
"Books?" → getcatalog(collection_name="Books")
"show Books" → getcatalog(collection_name="Books")
"Do you have Electronics?" → getcatalog(collection_name="Electronics")
"show Electronics" → getcatalog(collection_name="Electronics")
"Electronics?" → getcatalog(collection_name="Electronics")
"Show Furniture" → getcatalog(collection_name="Furniture")
"Clothing catalog" → getcatalog(collection_name="Clothing")
```

**Coverage:**
- ✅ All 4 collection names (Books, Electronics, Furniture, Clothing)
- ✅ Multiple phrasings ("show", "do you have", single word)
- ✅ Question marks and casual variations

### **3. Product Search Examples (4 examples)**
```python
"Find laptops under 50000" → searchproducts(keyword="laptop", max_price=50000)
"search for Samsung" → searchproducts(keyword="Samsung")
"find chairs" → searchproducts(keyword="chair")
"looking for Atomic Habits" → searchproducts(keyword="Atomic Habits")
```

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Specific product types (laptop, chair)
- ✅ Brand names (Samsung)
- ✅ Book titles (Atomic Habits)
- ✅ With price filters

### **4. Order Query Examples (4 examples)**
```python
"Do you have my order?" → getorder(parameters={})
"my order status" → getorder(parameters={})
"I placed an order earlier" → getorder(parameters={})
"What's in my cart cart454?" → getorder(cart_id="cart454")
```

**Coverage:**
- ✅ Vague queries (use session email)
- ✅ Specific cart IDs
- ✅ Various phrasings

### **5. Cart Operation Examples (6 examples)**
```python
"Add Atomic Habits" → addtocart(product_name="Atomic Habits", quantity=1)
"Add 2 Samsung Galaxy" → addtocart(product_name="Samsung Galaxy", quantity=2)
"Show my cart" → viewcart(parameters={})
"Remove Atomic Habits" → removefromcart(product_name="Atomic Habits")
"Clear cart" → clearcart(parameters={})
"Checkout" → checkout(parameters={})
```

**Coverage:**
- ✅ All 5 cart tools
- ✅ With/without quantities
- ✅ Product name variations

### **6. General Tools (3 examples)**
```python
"What collections do you have?" → listcollections
"Hello there" → null (no tool)
"Multiply 5 and 3" → multiply(a=5, b=3)
```

---

## 📈 **Total Coverage**

| Category | Examples | Coverage |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Collection Catalog | 9 | ✅ Complete |
| Product Search | 4 | ✅ Good |
| Order Queries | 4 | ✅ Good |
| Cart Operations | 6 | ✅ Complete |
| General Tools | 3 | ✅ Basic |
| **TOTAL** | **28** | **Comprehensive** |

---

## 🎯 **Key Improvements**

### **1. Explicit Collection Names**
```
BEFORE: "Show me Books" → searchproducts (generic)
AFTER:  "Show me Books" → getcatalog (9 examples show this!)
```

### **2. Multiple Variations**
```
"show Books"
"do you have Books?"
"Books?"
"show Electronics"
"Do you have Electronics?"
"Electronics?"
```

**Why:** Llama learns pattern → **Collection name mentioned = getcatalog**

### **3. Negative Examples**
```
"find laptop" → searchproducts ✅ (NOT a collection)
"search Samsung" → searchproducts ✅ (brand, not collection)
"looking for Atomic Habits" → searchproducts ✅ (specific item)
```

**Why:** Teaches Llama the difference!

### **4. Order Query Emphasis**
```
"Do you have my order?" → getorder ✅ (NOT searchproducts!)
"my order status" → getorder ✅
"I placed an order earlier" → getorder ✅
```

**Why:** Prevents "order" from matching product search

---

## 🧪 **Expected Improvements**

### **Test Case 1: "show me Books"**
```
BEFORE:
- LLM chooses: searchproducts(keyword='Books')
- Searches product_name ILIKE '%Books%'
- Finds: 0 products ❌

AFTER:
- LLM sees 9 examples with Books → getcatalog
- LLM chooses: getcatalog(collection_name='Books')
- Filters by collection_name = 'Books'
- Finds: 6 books ✅
```

### **Test Case 2: "do you have Electronics?"**
```
BEFORE:
- LLM: searchproducts(keyword='Electronics')
- Result: No products found ❌

AFTER:
- LLM sees: "Do you have Electronics?" example
- LLM chooses: getcatalog(collection_name='Electronics')
- Result: 6 electronics products ✅
```

### **Test Case 3: "Do you have my order?"**
```
BEFORE:
- LLM: No clear example
- Returns: {'cart_id': 'your_order_id'} (placeholder)
- Result: Error ❌

AFTER:
- LLM sees: "Do you have my order?" → getorder(parameters={})
- Returns: getorder with empty params
- Fallback uses session email ✅
```

## 📚 **Few-Shot Learning Principles Applied**

### **1. Coverage**
- ✅ Every major tool has examples
- ✅ Multiple variations per tool
- ✅ Edge cases covered

### **2. Distinction**
- ✅ Clear collection vs product examples
- ✅ Order vs search distinction
- ✅ Tool-specific vs general queries

### **3. Pattern Consistency**
- ✅ Same format for all examples
- ✅ Consistent parameter naming
- ✅ Clear reasoning for each

### **4. Progressive Complexity**
- Simple: "Books?" → getcatalog
- Medium: "Show me Books" → getcatalog
- Complex: "Find laptops under 50000" → searchproducts with filters

---

## 🎯 **Prompt Engineering Best Practices**

### **✅ What We Did Right:**

1. **Organized by Category**
   - Easier for Llama to learn patterns
   - Clear mental model

2. **Multiple Variations**
   - "show Books"
   - "do you have Books?"
   - "Books?"
   - All → same tool!

3. **Explicit Rules**
   - CRITICAL RULES section
   - Numbered for emphasis
   - ALWAYS/NEVER keywords

4. **Negative Examples**
   - Shows what NOT to do
   - "laptop" → searchproducts (not getcatalog)

5. **Reasoning Field**
   - Helps Llama understand WHY
   - "Books is a collection"
   - "Laptop is specific product, not collection"

## 🚀 **Expected Results**

### **Now These Should ALL Work:**

**Collection Browsing:**
```
✅ "show me Books"
✅ "do you have Books?"
✅ "Books?"
✅ "show Books catalog"
✅ "list Books"
✅ "Do you have Electronics?"
✅ "show Electronics"
✅ "Electronics?"

## 🧪 **Testing Recommendations**

Test ALL these variations:
```bash
# Collection queries (should use getcatalog)
"show me Books"
"do you have Books?"
"Books?"
"show Electronics"
"Electronics catalog"

# Product search (should use searchproducts)
"find laptop"
"search Samsung Galaxy"
"looking for chairs"

"Do you have my order?"
"my order"

# Cart operations
"Add Atomic Habits"
"Show cart"
