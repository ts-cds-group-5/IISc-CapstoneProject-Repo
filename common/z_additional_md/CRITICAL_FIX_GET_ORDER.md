# Critical Fix: Get Order Dual-Table Query

**Date:** October 11, 2025  
**Priority:** 🔴 CRITICAL  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  

---

## Problem Identified

**Critical Issue:** Orders placed via `checkout` tool were NOT retrievable via `get_order` tool!

### Root Cause:
```
checkout tool → Creates orders in g5_order table ✅
get_order tool → Queries cart table only ❌

Result: Users can't track orders they just placed!
```

---

## Solution Implemented

### **Dual-Table Query Strategy**

Updated `get_order` tool to query **BOTH** systems in priority order:

```
1. Query g5_order table (our shopping cart orders) FIRST
   ├─ If found → Return with full details
   └─ If not found → Continue to step 2

2. Query cart table (evershop system) as FALLBACK
   ├─ If found → Return with cart details
   └─ If not found → Return "not found" message
```

---

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
- `src/cccp/tools/order/get_order.py` (~150 lines added/modified)

### New Methods Added:

#### 1. `_query_g5_order()`
**Purpose:** Query g5_order and g5_order_items tables

**Queries:**
```sql
-- By order ID (if cart_id is numeric)
SELECT order_id, customer_name, customer_email, customer_phone,
       shipping_address, shipping_notes, payment_mode, order_status, total_price
FROM g5_order
WHERE order_id = $1
LIMIT 1

-- Get order items
SELECT product_id, product_name, currency, unit_price, quantity, line_total
FROM g5_order_items
WHERE order_id = $1
```

**Search Criteria:**
- By order_id (if cart_id parameter is numeric)
- By customer_email (most common)
- By customer_name

#### 2. `_get_order_items()`
**Purpose:** Fetch all items for a given order

**Returns:** List of order items with product details

#### 3. `_query_cart()`
**Purpose:** Query evershop cart table (original logic extracted)

**Same as before:** Queries cart table with status='true'

#### 4. `_transform_g5_order()`
**Purpose:** Transform g5_order data to unified format

**Returns:**
```python
{
    "order_id": "1",
    "customer_full_name": "Harish Achappa",
    "customer_email": "harish@gmail.com",
    "customer_phone": "9840913286",
    "shipping_address": "123 Main St...",
    "shipping_note": "Handle with care",
    "total": 34697.00,
    "currency": "INR",
    "payment_mode": "COD",
    "status": "received",
    "order_items": [...],  # Full items list
    "source": "shopping_cart",  # Identifies source
    "created_at": "...",
    "updated_at": "..."
}
```

#### 5. `_format_g5_order_response()`
**Purpose:** Format g5_order with full details including items

**Shows:**
- Order ID, Status, Payment Mode
- Customer Name, Email, Phone
- ALL Order Items with prices
- Shipping Address & Notes
- Total

#### 6. `_format_evershop_cart_response()`
**Purpose:** Format evershop cart (original logic)

**Shows:**
- Cart ID, Status
- Customer info
- Total
- Shipping note

## Query Flow

```
User: "I placed an order earlier"
    ↓
getorder tool (uses session email)
    ↓
_fetch_cart_async(customer_email="harish@gmail.com")
    ↓
_query_g5_order(client, email="harish@gmail.com")
    ├─ Query: SELECT * FROM g5_order WHERE customer_email = $1
    ├─ Found? → _get_order_items() → _transform_g5_order()
    └─ Not found? → Continue
    ↓
_query_cart(client, email="harish@gmail.com")
    ├─ Query: SELECT * FROM cart WHERE customer_email = $1
    ├─ Found? → _transform_evershop_cart()
    └─ Not found? → Return None
    ↓
_format_cart_response(order_details)
    ├─ source="shopping_cart"? → _format_g5_order_response()
    └─ source="evershop"? → _format_evershop_cart_response()
    ↓
Return formatted response to user
```

## Testing Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: User Places Order via Checkout**
```
1. User adds items to cart
2. User: "checkout, ship to 123 Main St"
3. Order created in g5_order with ID=1
4. User: "I placed an order earlier"
5. get_order queries g5_order by email
6. ✅ Found! Shows order #1 with all items
```

### **Scenario 2: User Has Evershop Cart**
```
1. User has cart454 in evershop system
2. User: "cart 454"
3. get_order queries g5_order first (not found)
4. get_order queries cart table (found!)
5. ✅ Shows cart454 details from evershop
```

### **Scenario 3: User Has Both**
```
1. User has both g5_order and cart
2. User: "my order"
3. get_order queries g5_order by email (found!)
4. ✅ Returns g5_order (priority over cart)
```

## Validation Checklist

### **Code Review:**
- ✅ Queries g5_order FIRST (priority)
- ✅ Falls back to cart if not found
- ✅ Handles all search methods (ID, email, name)
- ✅ Fetches order items from g5_order_items
- ✅ Transforms data consistently
- ✅ Formats responses with source indicator
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully
- ✅ Added List import for type hints
- ✅ Zero linting errors

### **Functional Requirements:**
- ✅ Users can track shopping cart orders
- ✅ Users can track evershop carts
- ✅ Priority order correct (g5_order first)
- ✅ Shows all order items
- ✅ Shows shipping details
- ✅ Source clearly indicated

### **Edge Cases:**
- ✅ No order in either table → "Not found" message
- ✅ Numeric cart_id → Tries as order_id in g5_order
- ✅ Email search → Works in both tables
- ✅ Name search → Works in both tables
- ✅ Database errors → Handled gracefully

---

## Impact

### **Before Fix:**
```
User: "I just placed an order"
Bot: "No active cart found for your email"  ❌ WRONG
```

### **After Fix:**
```
User: "I just placed an order"
Bot: [Shows order #1 with all items, shipping, etc.]  ✅ CORRECT
```

---

## Deployment Notes

### **Database Requirements:**
- ✅ g5_order table must exist
- ✅ g5_order_items table must exist
- ✅ cart table (evershop) - optional

### **Backwards Compatibility:**
- ✅ Existing evershop cart queries still work
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Seamless integration

### **Migration:**
- No migration needed
- Works immediately after deployment
- Both systems supported concurrently
