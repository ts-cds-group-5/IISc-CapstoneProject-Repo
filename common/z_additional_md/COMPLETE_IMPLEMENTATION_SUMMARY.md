## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### **Tool Detection Flow:**
```
User Query

Llama 3.2 (v2_llama_optimized)
    ├─ JSON Success → Execute Tool
    └─ JSON Fail → Regex Fallback
        ├─ Cart keywords → Cart tools
        ├─ Catalog keywords → Catalog tools
        └─ Order keywords → Order tools
    ↓
Tool Execution (with user_session passed to cart tools)
    ↓
MCP Postgres Client
    ↓
Database Query/Transaction
    ↓
Formatted Response
    ↓
User
```

### **State Management:**
```python
user_session = {
    'user_id': '867045',
    'name': 'Harish Achappa',
    'email': 'harish.achappa@gmail.com',
    'mobile': '9840913286',
    'registered_at': '2025-10-10T12:00:00',
